VPN
create a secure channel between two networks over an untrusted network
-authentication of the source->handshake
-data integrity->MAC
-replay suppression->sequence number

Why do we need TLS when we have VPN?
-data only secure in the tunnel
-unencrypted data is visible to VPN server
-VPN is not possible to authenticate the webserver only the tunnel endpoint

Why do we need VPN when we have TLS?
-VPN protect all traffic, including DNS requests and service that does not support TLS
-VPN give access to services in private network or behind firewalls

TLS: transport layer, end-to-end, not authenticate client, few standards
VPN: link/network layer, tunnel, authenticate client, many standards

IPsec
Step1: set up a security association(SA) via Internel Key Exchange(IKE)
Step2: enccapsulate packet and tunnel them between SA endpoints

Firewall
stateless firewall: packet filter
-network layer
-examine IP header
pros: application independent, good performance and scalability
cons: no state or application context

stateful firewall: session and packer filter
-session layer
-keep track of network connection state
pros: more powerful rules
cons: no use for stateless protocol like UDP, inconsistent state beween host and firewall, state explosion

Next generation firewall(NGFW): payload inspection

Web application firewall(WAF): protect web-based applications from malicious requests
-request filtering: request patterns(find attack pattern and identify future attack), SQL inject, XSS,..., blacklist/whitelist
-authentication: user authentication, session management
-TLS endpoint: reverse proxy: client is outside the internal work

Attack techniques
IP source spoofing: work for stateless protocol
artificial fragmentation: fragment packet to bypass rules
tunneling: use ICMP, DNS as channel, VPN

Detection techniques
reactive: only detect known attacks
proactive: detect both new and known attacks
deterministic: reason for alert is known
non-deterministic: depend on current state, eg. sandbox, ml, heuristic

static vs behavior
static: signature based detection: create and distribute signatures of known malware
pros: reliable, low rate of false positive, low resource requirement, fast
cons: reactive, problems of large scale distribution of signatures, frequent update of signatures, human in the loop

behavior: dynamic detection: sandbox/machine learning and classify upon observation
pros: proactive, no signature updates
cons: higher rate of false positives, resouce intensive, high latency, difficult to scale

Polymorphism techniques:
-swapping of equivalent code constructs
-changing the order of code
-inserting noise
-compiler modulation

accuracy vs precision
accuracy: close to target value
precision: not scatter

DoS
volumetric attack: consume the bandwidth, shrew attack
Example: coremelt and Crossfire
coremelt: exhaust bandwidth on victim link
crossfire: overload target links to disconnect target region from remainder of Internet
nameserver can no longer reply to legitimate requests

protocol attack: exhaust certain device, SYN/ACK floods
Example: DNS flooding-NXDOMAIN Attack
goal: overwhelm victim's authoritative name servers
Idea: query many non-existent subdomains of victim domain


application layer attack: application request floods, database connection pool exhaustion

Mitigations to IoT attack
-patch
-no hardcoded credentials, force user to change pwd
-ISP monitor network for suspicious traffic

defense agaist ip spoofing
-address filtering by ISPs->problem: no profit to do for ISP
-use connection-based protocols, eg.TCP ->problem: latency, memory and computation, state exhaustion DoS
-cryptographic source authentication->problem: DoS on asymmetric crypto, require symmetric key distribution or PKI

reflection and amplication: ip spoofing, send request to open server, larger or more response to victim
Mitigation to reflection and amplication
-prevent address spoofing
-perform access control
-response rate limiting
-small amplication factor

temporal lensing
-arrive at victim at the same time->trigger packet drop-> trigger retransmission wait->shrew attack

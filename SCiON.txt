SCiON

-stateless packet
-instant convergence
-path-aware
-multi-path
-scalability(AS level routing rather than IP prefix based routing)

Approach for Trust Scalability: Isolation Domain(ISD)
ISD: grouping of ASes -> fault is isolated, not transmitted
ISD core: ASes that manage ISD and provide global connectivity
Core AS: AS that is part of ISD core

Control Plane-Routing
-consructs and dissemminate path segment
path exploration, path dissemination, certificate dissemination/renewal

Data Plane-Packet forwarding
-Combine path segments to path
-packets contain path
-simple router, stateless

Intra-ISD Path exploration: beaconing
-Core ASes initial Path-segment Construction Beacons(PCBs) or beacons
what PCB(beacon) contains?
PCB creation time, path segment info(AS name, ...)

up-path segment: AS to core AS
down-path segment: core AS to AS

beaconing NOT rely on iterative convergence NOR forwarding table updates

what beaconing rely on?
Path Server Infrastructure
local path server: up-path segment
Core path server: up and down segment

SCiON drawbacks
-additional latency to obtain path->solution: but amortized by caching and path reuse
-bandwidth overhead: path in packet about 80 bytes->solution: path control, simpler data plane
-complexity in key management like new certificate->solution: no, but high security
-setup cost->solution: methods to facilitate deployment

Gate Approach against DDoS
-geofencing and path control

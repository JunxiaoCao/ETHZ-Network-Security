Anonymous Communication System

wireless communication:broadcast
-receiver anonymity
-sender is de-anonymized: location of sender can be calculated through triangulation
How to get sender anonymity?
-"burner phone": one time use
-hacked WiFi: hide identity
-Network ID != sender ID

proxy or VPN
-use layer encryption to hide content from proxy
-Problem1: proxy can still see metadata: communication partner addresses, ...
-Problem2: single point failure (kill-switch)
Solution: cascade of multiple proxies
-proxy only see addresses of neighbours
-work when at least one honest proxy
-encryted at each layer, all keys needed to decrypt

Mix-nets
-intended to send anonymous email
-latency is not big concern, no connection setup
-built on asymmetric crytography
-Problem1: network attacker can observe in- and outgoing message
Solution1: batching and mixing
-collect messages before forwarding(threshold)
-change the order of messages(mix)
-padding every message
-Problem2: intersection attack: users only commnicate with a small set of other users, observing long term message destinations
Solution: cover traffic -> achieve unobservability
-dummy, chaf, padding traffic
-both for sender and receiver
-when receiver retrieves msg, message->download, no message->dummy msg download

BGP Hijacks
IP prefix hijack: malicious AS announces prefix it does not own.
Problem 1: BGP does not validate the origin of advertisement
-annouce same prefix
-annouce more specific prefix(stronger variation)
Q: Why cannot AS annouce more specific prefix to avoid this problem?
A: Because it will cause a larger routing table and more expensive to update.
-harder to be find: selective announcement
-BGP poisoning

How to perform BGP interception?
step1: set up an AS and border router or compromise someone else's border router
step2: configure router to originate taget (sub)prefix
step3: get other ASes to accept the wrong route

Problem 2: BGP does not validate the content of advertisement
AS can modify the BGP path: 
-remove ASes from the AS path->make the path shorter to attract traffic and attract sources that try to avoid removed AS
-add ASes to AS path->trigger loop detection: DOS and bgp poisoning

Solution1: Resource Public Key Infrastructure(RPKI) and Origin Anthentication <=> Route Origin Verification -> solve problem 1
-RPKI enables ROA
-ROA states which AS is authorized to announce certain IP prefix: specify the maximum length of the prefix->prevent sub-prefix hijacking
-out-of-band checking -> no need to modify BGP

Solution2: BGPsec -> solve problem2
-secure AS-PATH attribute in BGP announcement
-each AS sign BGP announcement as they forward it
-verify path signature, add own entry, indicate next AS, sign the message

SCION: specify the path

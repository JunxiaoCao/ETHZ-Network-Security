Botnet
bot master connects to several control server, asynchronous, ad-hoc connection
drop zone: host where exfiltrated data is stored util pickup by bot master
bot agent lifecycle: initialize, exploitation, termination
botnet topologies: botnet command model and botnet topologies
botnet command model: 
-no control: default malicious behaviors; less flexible, detected by signatures; most resistant to global shutdown
-private channels: custom and covert channels, abuse or alternation of common protocols, short-term stealth, signature detection easy once CnC observed
-public infrastructure: use common app API, reliable and anonymous
-resilient hybrids: "default", fallback plan if CnC not available, pre-programmed contact points
botnet topology
-star: instruction/data transfer fast, kill-switch
-multi-server: resilient, geographical optimization, require advanced planning for setup
-hierarchical: not aware of the whole rest botnet, ease of resell, higher latency
-peer 2 peer: no centric CnC, very resilient, monitor single bot can enumerate others, unpredictable flow, latency
